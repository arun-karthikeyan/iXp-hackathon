## Please create .gitignore file by using <i>"touch .gitignore"</i> command.
## Add all the files that should not be pushed into git. 
## For example: My .gitignore file contains
        node-modules/*  --> We put required modules in package.json and do npm install after every pull.
        .idea/* --> This folder contains IDE setting's which should not be pushed.
              
## Please update and add .gitignore file accordingly.
